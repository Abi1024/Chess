# Chess
Implementation of the board game chess on the Processing language. I made this for fun on the summer of 2015.

En-passant, castling, and pawn promotion are all correctly supported. Editing the board is not a supported featue as of yet.
As of now the program is designed for two player hotseat matches, but I am thinking about adding an AI in the future.
